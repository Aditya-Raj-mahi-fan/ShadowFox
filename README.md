This repository is totally dedicated to the tasks assigned to me during the internship at ShadowFox.
Task 1 : Beginner Level Task
Visualization Library Documentation
Objective: Create a comprehensive documentation guide for 2 of the following Python visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh, and Pandas. Your guide should focus on the variety of graphs each library can generate and include practical examples with code snippets.
Requirements:
1. Library Overview: Provide a brief introduction to the selected libraries, highlighting their unique features and typical use cases.
2. Graph Types:
- Document the different types of graphs available in each library, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, pie charts, etc.
- For each graph type, include a brief description, potential use case, and a simple code example demonstrating how to generate the graph.
3. Comparison: Offer a comparison section discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each library regarding ease of use, customization options, interactivity, and performance with large datasets.
Task 2 : Intermediate Level Task
Conduct an in-depth analysis of the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi, addressing the specific environmental challenges faced by the city. Define research questions centered around key pollutants,seasonal variations, and the impact of geographical factors on air quality. Utilize statistical analyses and visualizations to gain insights into the dynamics of AQI in Delhi, offering a comprehensive understanding that can inform targeted strategies for air quality improvement and public health initiatives in the region.
Task 3 : Hard Level Task
Cricket Fielding Analysis Data Collection Objective: As a budding sports analyst with an interest in cricket, your task is to conduct a detailed fielding performance analysis for three players of your choice from any innings of a T20 match. This analysis will help to gauge individual fielding contributions and their impact on the team's defensive play. A detailed sample data and sample performance matrix is attached along the mail of task list.
Dataset Features:
- Match No.: Identifier for the match.
- Innings: Which innings the data is being recorded for.
- Team: The team in the field.
- Player Name: The fielder involved in the action.
- Ballcount: Sequence number of the ball in the over.
- Position: Fielding position of the player at the time of the ball.
- Short Description: Brief description of the fielding event.
- Pick: Categorize the pick-up as clean pick, good throw, fumble, bad
throw, catch, or drop catch.
- Throw: Classify the throw as run out, missed stumping, missed run
out, or stumping.
- Runs: Enter the number of runs saved (+) or conceded (-) through the
fielding effort.
- Overcount: The over number in which the event occurred.
- Venue: Location of the match .
Performance Metrics Formula:
To assess the fielding performance, use the following formula:
PS=(CP×WCP)+(GT×WGT)+(C×WC)+(DC×WDC)+(ST×WST)+
(RO×WRO )+(MRO×WMRO)+(DH×WDH)+RS
Where:
PS: Performance Score
CP: Clean Picks
GT: Good Throws
C: Catches
DC: Dropped Catches
ST: Stumpings
RO: Run Outs
MRO: Missed Run Outs
DH: Direct Hits
RS: Runs Saved (positive for runs saved, negative for runs conceded)
Task Instructions:
1. Data Collection: For each ball bowled in the match, record the fielding
effort according to the dataset features outlined above. Pay close attention
to the effectiveness of fielding actions and their outcomes.
2. Analysis Preparation: Your collected data will be used for advanced
fielding analysis, identifying key areas of improvement and fielding strengths
within the team.
Deliverable: A well-organized spreadsheet or database containing the
complete fielding data for the match.
This task requires meticulous attention to detail and an understanding of
cricket fielding dynamics. Your analysis will contribute to strategic fielding
placements and improvements in team performance.
